# Whiteboard Frontend
This repository is for the frontend portion of my fullstack busines branding app "Whiteboard". The app automates the task of the creating, designing greeting cards, pamphlets, banners for various events for individuals, shops, businesses etc. The frontend of the application (Business branding Application) is created using Javascript & React. The necessary features for image editing/maipulation is integrated into the app using Fabric.js.

Some of the features of the app are:
  - Add elements(shapes, text, images) on the HTML canvas.
  - Upload images(internal & external) to the account.
  - Change the font size, font-family, color and other properties of the text on the canvas.
  - Change the size, orientation, transparency of the images.
  - Save the canvas as a PNG to local device.
  - Save the canvas into database for later use.
